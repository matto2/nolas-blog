Thanks for visiting! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Matt (Nolaâ€™s dad) and  made this blog to share one of Nolaâ€™s writing assignments at school.

<strong>Why not just post on social media? </strong> That's always an option but I'm not a fan of FB. Also, I like to practice building things on the web and sharing the process with anyone who's interested. Plan is to share more made-by-Nola content here over time. And I'll transition into more of a facilitator role.
